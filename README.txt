nAnagramarama

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  I ported this from a SDL game called Anagramarama!  It works on the TI-NSpire with ndless 3.1.  I tested with a non CX and a CX model of the TI-NSpire  The gameplay is you find words out of the letters provided.

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop all of the files with the extension tns into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Type the letters and they will appear in the guess area.  Type them in the order that the word you are thinking of is in order.
To clear the guess press the Del (Clear) key.
To try the word press Enter key.
If the word is taken the answer is displayed below.  There are many answers possible and use the left and right parentheses to scroll the answers.
Press the space button to scrable the available letters; it might help you find words!
To see answers press the Tab key.
To start a new puzzle click the plus (+) key.

Have fun!

Other languages:
If you would like to use a language other than English; in the i18n directory there are two alternatives: French and Portuguese!  There languages were from the program I modified.  To use, overwrite the English version of those files on your calculator and start the game!

Source:
I included the source; I modified an existing program.  Here is a link to the code I modified from: http://code.google.com/p/anagramarama/  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
